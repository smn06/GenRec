# GenRec - Reinforcement Learning for Recommender Systems with GAN-Generated User Profiles

## Overview
GenRec is a cutting-edge project that leverages the power of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create realistic user profiles and preferences for recommendation systems. By combining GAN-generated user data with Reinforcement Learning (RL), GenRec aims to optimize the recommendation process, providing more personalized and accurate suggestions to users.
